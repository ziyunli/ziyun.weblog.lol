# A Shopping Trip during Lockdown

I braved it out and went to shop for grocery today, despite COVID-19.

The first stop was to Winco. Surprisingly, there are still many people in store, much more compared to what I saw in Walmart a week ago (granted that was on a weekday morning). People in general are well protected. There were only one lady I saw that wasn't wearing facial mask. Not all people wore hand gloves, but the store does provide hand sanitizer right at the gate. The lines were super long just like any weekend before COVID-19. Oh they even have facial masks and hand sanitizers in stock. A small bottle of hand sanitizers costs more than $10. Crazy time to be alive.

The next stop was to The Alley, as we're all craving for bubble teas. The plaza was very empty, very much different from what it used to be. No line in The Alley either. Then I went to Soho and it was pretty much the same. Very empty plaza, very few people in the bakery store. The dining business may take the strongest hit overall.

The drive was very casual, with minimal traffic on road. I used to complain a lot about GTA traffic and the parking situation in a lot of plazas. But what I saw today makes me really sad. Sincerely hope this can be over soon so that more small and medium business can survive.
