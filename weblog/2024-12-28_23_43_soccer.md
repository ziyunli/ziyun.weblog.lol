# Soccer

I still vaguely remember the first time I got into soccer as a kid. I can’t recall exactly when it was, but it was shortly after my family moved from a small town to a third-tier city. At the time, Manchester United was still the strongest team in the Premier League, and David Beckham was on the cover of every sports newspaper and magazine. I think I was around 7 or 8 years old then.

At some point, I got a soccer ball and a pair of cleats—I think they were 回力钉鞋. The neighborhood we lived in had quite a few lawns between the apartment buildings, so I would run around with the ball, practicing passing and shooting against the wall of a nearby building. Eventually, the residents of the building couldn’t take it anymore and wrote on the wall: “在此踢球者付款50元” (“50 yuan fine for playing soccer here”). For a kid, 50 yuan was a huge amount of money, so I had no choice but to stop.

The nearest field was in a nearby school, about a 10-minute walk away, but it was basically just sand and rocks. My school didn’t have a soccer field either—only a concrete court. So, after a brief time trying out soccer, I gave it up and turned to playing ping pong.

Still, I kept wearing those 回力钉鞋. In fact, they were pretty much the only shoes I wore for most of elementary school. I also started watching soccer games on TV. A few years later, the first video game I played was _FIFA 98_, and by middle school, I had started playing _Championship Manager 03/04_. Even though I never actually played soccer again, it stayed with me in one way or another.

To my surprise, soccer came back into my life when my eldest son started elementary school. He first got into soccer at around 4 years old because it was the only ball sport he could play at the time. I didn’t know how to teach him, so we just chased the ball and kicked it around casually. Compared to other sports we introduced (which he wasn’t interested in), he seemed more into soccer. So, we occasionally signed him up for recreational programs.

One day, to my surprise, he asked me to play soccer with him after school at a multi-sport field near his school. Later, I found out that he had already started playing soccer with other elementary school kids during recess. At the time, I was on parental leave with my second child, so I happened to have free time. Playing soccer quickly became part of our daily after-school routine—we played until it got completely dark every day.

Unfortunately, by early November, daylight saving time ended, and it got dark by 4 p.m., so we couldn’t play anymore. Given my skill level (almost zero), there wasn’t much I could teach him anyway, so we decided to sign him up for a tryout with a community soccer club.

Around the same time, our new neighbors moved in. Their child also played soccer, so we recommended the same club. When the club season started in January of the following year, a parent mentioned some WeChat groups for pickup soccer. My neighbor joined and asked if I wanted to try it out.

At first, I hesitated a little, but not for long. By then, I was used to learning new things for my kids. More importantly, there was something strangely meaningful about picking up soccer again after nearly 30 years. So, I started playing pickup soccer every Friday.

The first few months were really tough. I couldn’t receive passes, my passes weren’t accurate, and I couldn’t dribble at all. The only thing I could do was run around like a headless chicken. But by the end of 2024, I finally started to feel better. I was more comfortable and relaxed on the field and could even start observing what was happening around me. Through light practice sessions while helping my kids train and some casual drills on weekends, I gradually regained my touch. Progress was slow, but the effort paid off.

Sometimes I joke with my wife that kids these days are so lucky when it comes to soccer. There are fields everywhere, complete with lights so they can play even after dark, and they have formal training sessions several times a week. For the 7-year-old me, that would have been a dream.

But deep down, I feel more grateful than anything. It’s my kids who truly brought me into the world of soccer.
