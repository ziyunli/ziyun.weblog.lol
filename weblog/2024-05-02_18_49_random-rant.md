# Random Rant

Transferring out from [Mint Mobile](https://www.mintmobile.com/) is harder than I thought.

First, I needed an account number and a PIN. But on that day, there was a multi-hour outage on their customer portal, so I couldn't log in. Then I discovered that the mobile app was actually working... Are they using different servers behind the scenes?

Anyway, I got in, and then realized that I needed to go through customer support to acquire the account number. I first tried the chatbot, and apparently, it tried its hardest to give me useful advice instead of just spitting out the account number. At some point, this felt like playing a text adventure game, but when I got to the very end, it asked me to call, so not a very rewarding one.

Calling in was actually fine in the sense that it only took a couple of minutes until someone picked up the call. Besides the usual retention play ("It took several minutes to generate the account number, meanwhile I would like to let you know that you are qualified for this wonderful offer..."), I was able to get the number successfully. The only weird thing was that I was asked to turn on 2FA before the agent could access the account number... Does it mean the agent actually logged into my account? Also, the web portal was still down at the time(!), but I managed to turn it off on my mobile app.

I ended up moving to Google FI, and let's see if that goes well.
