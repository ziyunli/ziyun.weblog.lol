# Weblog

This is an incomplete dump of my weblog https://ziyun.weblog.lol/.

~~This process now is a bit manual: I need to click the "Export" button on https://home.omg.lol/address/ziyun/weblog/configuration, unzip the downloaded package, and paste into this repo. Also note that the export does _NOT_ include pages, and thus I have to manually maintain a `pages` folder here to track.~~
